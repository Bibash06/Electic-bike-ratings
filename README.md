Analysis of electric bike
Background
EMO is a manufacturer of electric motorcycles.
EMO launched its first electric motorcycle in India in 2019.

The product team has been asking website users to rate the motorcycles.
Ratings from owners help the product team to improve the quality of the motorcycles.
Ratings from non-owners help the product team add new features. They hope the new features will increase the number of new customers.
The product team wants to extend the survey. But, they want to be sure they can predict whether the ratings came from owners or non-owners.
